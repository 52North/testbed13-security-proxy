== OAuth Scopes

Scopes were defined on two levels: (1) operation and (2) feature type/process level. On the operation level, we defined scopes like Execute, DescribeProcess or GetFeature. If a client is authorized for the respective scope, it can call the operation with no limitation, e.g. call Execute on all processes or get all feature types. To allow more fine-grained access control, we defined scopes on feature type/process level. The scheme for these scopes is: Operation/AttributeName=AttributeValue, e.g. Execute/ProcessID=my.process or DescribeFeatureType/TypeName=my.feature.
